    <h1>How to Hold in a Fart</h1>
  <p>You're on a date, sitting in math class, or just in a room full of people in a really quiet place and you feel the urge to pass gas. In an ideal world, you would be able to just run off and let the fart out of your system, but you may not always have the option. Sometimes, the only thing you can do is to hold in your fart to avoid embarrassment. So how do you do it? Step 1 to get started!</p>

    Part 1: Strategies for Holding in Your Fart <br>

        <b> 1. <big>Clench your butt-cheeks.</b></b></big> <br>

        Think of it this way: if there's no space between your butt-cheeks, then how can the fart get out? Though this can be a bit painful and can't be sustained for that long, if you clench your cheeks, you will prevent your fart from escaping. To do this, you really have to tighten your anus and have it stay that way; if you let go, you are more likely to release the fart. If you're lucky, doing this for long enough can help the fart get "sucked up" back into your body -- just know that this isn't a permanent solution, and that the fart may return with more force than before.

        <b> 2.  <big> Slowly change positions. </big></b><br>

        Sometimes you may just need to wiggle around a bit to move that fart to a different part of your body. Just don't make any sudden movements or the fart may be more likely to come out. If you're sitting, try standing up. If you're standing, sit down. If you're sitting but can't get up, try shifting from one butt cheek to the other.
